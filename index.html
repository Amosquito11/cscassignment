<br>So far so good, my life has been fun, interesting, challenging and at the same time educative.<br>
<br> I'm a gregarious fellow and this has made me achieved a lot especially humanitarian services. 
 <br>I'm a staunch activist and through God almighty 2017  <br>
  <br>I was able to establish a foundation called DANIEL CHARITY FOUNDATION.<br>
<br>2015 I won an award as the writer of the year at the Stephaine Emirates Academy <br>
 <br>2018 I obtained a Jupeb certificate which i used as direct transfer to Kwara State University, MALETE. <br>
 <br> A world class and Nigeria No.1 fatest University. <br>
 <br>I love art and literatures which has enabled me to win actor of the year in my erstwhile church: WINNERS CHAPEL. <br>
 <br>Basically and professionally, I'm a poet, actor, writer and activist and i still hope on achieving many more in the nearest future. <br>
